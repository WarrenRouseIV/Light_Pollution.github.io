            <strong> Overview </strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            Light pollution is excessive, misdirected, or obtrusive artificial (usually outdoor) light. Components of light pollution include glare – excessive brightness that causes visual discomfort, skyglow – brightening of the night sky over inhabited areas, light trespass – light falling where it is not intended or needed, and clutter – bright confusing and excessive groupings of light sources. A common example of spill light is light from a streetlight coming through a window and illuminating a bedroom, light from outdoor wall lights that direct light up towards the sky rather than towards the ground, or light from a neighbor's floodlight or security light shining over the fence and illuminating your property. These components and light pollution as a whole pose a threat to the health of humans and wildlife, contribution to climate change, an absurd amount of energy consumption, safety for humans and wildlife, and our ability to see stars at night.

    <strong> Data </strong>
    <br>
    <br>
“The brightness map reveals that 83% of the world's population, and 99% of Europeans and people in the US, live under skies nearly 10% brighter than their natural starry state. For some, though the artificial glow was even greater,” said Dr. Kyba. - BBC News 
     <br>       
"When Los Angeles recently replaced more than 150,000 streetlights with LEDs, the city saved roughly 8 million dollars annually, or more than 60 percent on energy costs."(NatGeo)
    <br>
A 2007 IDA study estimated that 30% of all light emitted is wasted, which equates to 22 Terawatt hours/year, About 3.6 million tons of coal per year, about 12.9 million barrels of oil per year

    <strong> Effects </strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    Artificial lights and light pollution affect animals and humans in several ways. Animals that have niches that rely on the natural day/night cycle are heavily affected by artficial lights and skyglow, and humans’ melatonin production can often be interrupted due to the artificially bright night sky. Skyglow also makes it difficult for astronomers to do their jobs, and for satellites to properly collect data.</p>
