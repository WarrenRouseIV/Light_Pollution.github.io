                My name is Ethan Armstead, I am a second year scholar at SMASH morehouse, and I attend Maynard Jackson High School. I’m interested in the STEM field, specifically mathematics and computer science, and I also enjoy roleplaying video games. I aspire to be a cyber security professional and study cryptography, the study of computer systems encryption and decryption. I wanted to do light pollution for our program’s end of the summer project because it was a topic that I was very ignorant about, and I knew that this would be a great learning experience.

             Hello. My name is Warren Nicholas Rouse IV. I am a rising junior  at Charles R. Drew Charter Senior Academy.I am 16 years old and originally from Anaheim, CA. I aspire to attend the University of Kentucky and be a Sports Journalist. I am currently in the National Beta club at my school.  I've wanted to be a sports journalist since I was young due to sports being my passion. I wanted to do light pollution because one night driving there was so much glare in my neighborhood it gave me a migraine and I never wanted to have that happen again
