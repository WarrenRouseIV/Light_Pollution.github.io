            Glare poses a visible obstruction to citizens and animals, light trespass coming from people’s overlit homes may cause an annoyance for their neighbors and others, skyglow is a visible problem that we see every night, and inefficient lights that most of the world has been using for a couple of years are starting to show there environmental and financial strain. Our solution seeks to address these issues by asking the question: How might we allow for light emissions to be more environmentally friendly and less used by citizens living in cities and urban areas? Our answer to this question is a light product that is an amalgamation of an LED light that has adjustable spectrum settings and a built-in cone shield around it, as well as an app that can allow for the user to turn off unused lights around their homes and/or offices. </p> </div>

        <p class="marginright"> Globe at night explains that light pollution can be combated in a couple of ways, two being significant solutions that our project focuses on: properly shielding lights and only using lights when they're needed. In National Geographic’s article written by Nadia Drake, it’s stated that: "He (Kyba in his 2017 study) and others say that dimmer, warmer, and shielded LEDs could be hugely beneficial for both dark skies and energy budgets." This is why our LED bulb will be adjustable between a colder blue light setting that provides more light, to a warmer amber light setting which is more environmentally friendly and healthy to humans and animals. With the app and sensors that can be placed about one’s office and/or home in order to turn off lights that aren’t being used, paired with our light product that utilizes efficient LEDs while decreasing glare, light trespass, and skyglow which can also be installed about one’s office and/or home, we seek to decrease the effects and potency of light pollution.
